# Connect 4!
A simple connect 4 game made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's played with 2 players, and the first to get 4 in a row wins!
_Technologies used_: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

**Future implementations:**
In the future, I hope to rebuild this game but with a twist that allows users to replace one of the other playerâ€™s tokens once every 3 turns. The objective would still be to achieve 4 in a row but this would allow players to have a second chance at winning.
